Summary of Possible Mitigation Approaches
Sponge and other resource-exhaustion attacks on LLMs can be addressed through several methods, both inhibiting the attack from occurring and lowering its impact:

Input validation and sanitization:
    -Checking the length and complexity of the input.
    -Elimination of potentially malicious or overly resource-intensive patterns.
    -Limits on the size of the input context window.

Output length and complexity constraints:
    -Capping the number of tokens that can be generated by the LLM in a single output.
    -Enforcing mechanisms to detect and cap repetitive or infinite generations.

Resource monitoring and rate limiting:
    -Monitoring the resources consumed by individual users and requests.
    -Applying rate limits to the amount or depth of requests made by a single user within an interval of time.
    -Detecting and possibly blocking users or IP addresses exhibiting unusual, resource-intensive activity.

Load balancing and autoscaling:
    -Sharding incoming requests across numerous LLM instances to prevent the single instance from being overwhelmed.
    -Scaling resources up dynamically when there is greater demand (though this does not prevent the higher cost per request of sponge attacks).

Model optimization and efficiency:
    -Using more efficient LLM models or optimized inference techniques that are less susceptible to input-dependent computational spikes.
    -Using techniques like quantization and model pruning to reduce the computational expense of inference.

Behavioral analysis:
    -Tracking patterns of user interaction to detect patterns of queries that are characteristic of attack attempts as opposed to normal use.
