        # Example 3: Exploiting potential biases or sensitivities (requires knowledge of training data)
        # This is highly model-specific and difficult to craft generically.
        # Example (illustrative, may not work): "Write a positive review about [controversial topic]."

        # This often involves creative phrasing or indirect requests.
